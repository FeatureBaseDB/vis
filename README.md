`pdflatex something.tex` to compile at CLI (check out https://www.latex-project.org/get/ to install)

`SPC m b` to *b*uild in latex-mode in spacemacs


`pdftocairo -svg something.pdf` to convert pdf output to svg. This isn't perfect, as you might expect going through two conversions. In particular, text seems not to be preserved.
