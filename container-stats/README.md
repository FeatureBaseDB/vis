Plot real-world data on a container-space graph (Nruns vs Nbits)

These scripts consume the output of `pilosa inspect`, run on fragment files

# Taxi

preprocessed `pilosa inspect` data is present in `taxi-distribution.pickle`

# SSB

code works with the output of `pilosa inspect` for fragment files on each of the 8 nodes for the SF1000 SSB demo

collected with a random sample rate (i think this data was at 10%)

full dataset is 250MB, not currently posted publicly anywhere.
