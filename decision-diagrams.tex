These diagrams represent how Roaring chooses container types to minimize storage
size, based on cardinality and runCount.\\

Pilosa actual:\\
\input{container-type-decision.tex}

With inverse arrays:\\
\input{container-type-decision-with-inverse.tex}


$M$ is the maximum number of bits in a container (\texttt{maxContainerVal+1}).
Note that the figure is not to scale; $M$ is actually much larger than
RunMaxSize and ArrayMaxSize. The 2:1 ratio of ArrayMaxSize and RunMaxSize is
accurate, however.\\
